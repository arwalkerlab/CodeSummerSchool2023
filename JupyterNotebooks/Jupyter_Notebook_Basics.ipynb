    "# Introduction to Jupyter Notebooks\n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter notebooks are a handy tool that will allow you to write code and annotate with text-based sections.  Notebooks are divided into \"cells\", which in the standard form include `Markdown` and `Code` types.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `Markdown` cells (such as the one in which these words appear) are useful for writing plain text, displaying static images, linking to external websites or sources, and using $\\LaTeX$ formatting for math or other things.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `Code` cells are where your actual code goes.  The programming language to be used is determined by the kernel, which in our case is the Python3 kernel (see the upper-right corner of the notebook page).  This means all code must be in the Python 3 code format.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is possible to install kernels for other programming languages, however the process is somewhat more involved and is not necessary for this workshop.\n",
    "\n",
    "____\n",
    "\n",
    "Each notebook can be thought of as an interactive code session.  Every cell that has been \"run\" updates the overall session for that notebook.  In this way, you can divide up larger tasks into smaller pieces, carry variable information from one cell to the next, and define functions or set up workflows early on to then use later in the notebook.  There are also a number of ways to interact with things outside the notebook, such as files or even the system itself.\n"
