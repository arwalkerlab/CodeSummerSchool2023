    "# Introduction to Jupyter Notebooks\n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter notebooks are a handy tool that will allow you to write code and annotate with text-based sections.  Notebooks are divided into \"cells\", which in the standard form include `Markdown` and `Code` types.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `Markdown` cells (such as the one in which these words appear) are useful for writing plain text, displaying static images, linking to external websites or sources, and using $\\LaTeX$ formatting for math or other things.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `Code` cells are where your actual code goes.  The programming language to be used is determined by the kernel, which in our case is the Python3 kernel (see the upper-right corner of the notebook page).  This means all code must be in the Python 3 code format.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is possible to install kernels for other programming languages, however the process is somewhat more involved and is not necessary for this workshop.\n",
    "\n",
    "____\n",
    "\n",
    "Each notebook can be thought of as an interactive code session.  Every cell that has been \"run\" updates the overall session for that notebook.  In this way, you can divide up larger tasks into smaller pieces, carry variable information from one cell to the next, and define functions or set up workflows early on to then use later in the notebook.  There are also a number of ways to interact with things outside the notebook, such as files or even the system itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the first few cells, we have the variable `x` being given different values.  The middle cell prints out the current value of `x` whenever you run it.  Run the first three cells in order, then run the `print(x)` command cell again and see how it changes the output.  This is to illustrate the point above, that every cell changes the overall environment as you run it.  So be careful about what variables you use, when and where you use them, and how they might get reassigned.\n",
    "\n",
    "The fourth cell also deletes the variable entirely.  Try it out, followed again by the `print(x)` cell, to see the effects."

    "The use of `.call()` allows each step of the output to be printed immediately to our console as the process runs, while the `.Popen()` immediately \"completes\".  The next cell with `.communicate()` doesn't give us anything until the entire process has completed.  This is fine if we just need to capture the entire output or if we just need the process to start while the rest of our program continues on.  We can, however, use another method to reclaim the immediacy of `.call()`, which can be useful if we need to watch for a specific pattern in the output.  In the expanded example below, we've added another `sleep 3` command, followed by `echo porcupine`.  This means the entire process should take six seconds (printing the text is effectively zero time for our purposes)."
