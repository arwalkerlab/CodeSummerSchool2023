\section{Input/Output}
\paragraph{} The most basic functionality is input from and output to the terminal.  These are accomplished with \texttt{std::cin} and \texttt{std::cout}.  The following example prompts the user to enter an integer value, stores it, and then prints it back out.

\begin{minted}{c++}
#include <iostream>
#include <cstdlib>
int main()
{
    int my_integer;
    std::cout << "Enter an integer: ";
    std::cin >> my_integer;
    std::cout << "You entered " << my_integer << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
\end{minted}
This example also introduces the next section on variables.

\begin{homework}
Try creating some small programs to deal with inputs and outputs from the terminal.  Don't forget to compile before trying to run the programs!
