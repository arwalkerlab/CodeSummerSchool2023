\section{Definitions}
Definitions are the complete set of instructions for a function.  They begin just like a declaration, except that instead of a semicolon, they have the open- and close-curly braces with the full set of commands inside.

\begin{minted}{c++}
int myfunction(int var1, int var2)
{
  // I can have comments inside the function as well.
  // In fact, I really should have comments inside functions to help other programmers know what's happening.
  int answer;
  answer = var1 + var2;
  return answer;
}
\end{minted}

The full function definition above has the return type, arguments, and complete instructions inside the scope, ending with the return value.
