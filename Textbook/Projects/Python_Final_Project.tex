\section{Python - The Final Project!}

Work together to create a python module that can help lab members
process, analyze, and present data from TeraChem calculations.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Ground State Optimization
\item
  Excited State Single Point Energy
\item
  Ground State Molecular Dynamics
\item
  Excited State Optimization
\item
  Excited State Molecular Dynamics
\end{enumerate}

Come up with some different things we want to know from each of these
calculations, then write functions, classes, or modules to process the
outputs from these different calculations and give us condensed reports
or plots to make it easy to review.

Figure out the parts of the process, create pseudocode, and build your
program!
