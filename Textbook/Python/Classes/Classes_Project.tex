\section{Classes Project}
Let's build some classes of our own!

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Write a class to hold a dictionary of TeraChem keywords and their
  values. Include a function to print out these keyword/value
  combinations similar to how they would appear in a TeraChem input
  file.
\item
  Write a class that takes a single filename (without the extension) and
  creates its own set of filenames (WITH extension) to use as a TeraChem
  command line. Include a function that prints out the custom TeraChem
  command line. Include an option to send the command to the background
  immediately, freeing up the python interpreter for any additional
  work.
\item
  Write a set of classes to hold information about your research
  projects. The main class should have basic information like ``Topic''
  or ``Date Started''. Then, use inheritance to create some subclasses
  for things like ``Collaborations'' or ``Internal'' or ``Single
  Author'' projects. You can decide what kinds of information each of
  these unique classes might need.
\end{enumerate}

Try instantiating (\emph{fancy word for creating}) instances of each of
your new classes, call their internal functions, print out different
internal variables, etc. Have fun, make a mess, go wild!
