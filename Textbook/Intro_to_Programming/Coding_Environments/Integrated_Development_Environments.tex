\section{Introduction to IDEs}

An Integrated Development Environment (IDE) is a tool that can help keep your code projects organized, handle housekeeping, interact with multiple different kinds of files, and even provide assistance with compilation, testing, and debugging.
There are a number of different IDEs out there, with each one having its own strengths and weaknesses.

For example, Atom was a powerful, community-driven, open-source IDE with tons of customization and plugin options for a huge variety of functions.
Its primary weakness now, however, is that it has been officially closed down and is no longer supported by the original developers.Fortunately, many of those developers moved over to our next example.

Microsoft's Visual Studio Code (VSCode for short) is one of the most popular IDEs due to the relative ease of use for beginners and the expandability and availability of additional plugins and extensions to broaden its capacity.
Among these extensions are things like \LaTeX compilers, PDF viewers, code-highlighting, GitHub interactions, and notebook controls.
