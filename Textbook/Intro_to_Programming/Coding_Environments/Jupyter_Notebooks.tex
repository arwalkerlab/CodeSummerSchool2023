\section{Jupyter Notebooks}
\paragraph{}A very useful tool for testing smaller functions or running interactive coding sessions is the Jupyter Notebook.
The installation is usually done as part of an \texttt{anaconda} installation.
Startup of a notebook session is specific to your operating system, however the session itself is usually held in your web browser.
Notebooks are an interactive environment with some graphical support, with the ability to annotate code cells with markdown cells mixed in.
Because they are cell-based environments, you can run individual cells out of order, or run the entire notebook in sequence.

By default, Jupyter Notebooks only include the ability to handle python kernels (the underlying compiler/interpreter for your code), however it is possible to install additional kernels for other languages.
This may have variable utility depending on the specific language being used and the overall goal of your projects.
For most simple programming projects, a notebook environment is sufficient for development and testing of functions, classes, and overall workflows.
More complicated projects may need better tools, but ultimately those decisions fall to the preferences of the specific programmer and the requirements of the project.
