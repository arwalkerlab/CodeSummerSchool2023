\section{Continuous Integration}
\paragraph{} Continuous integration (CI) refers to methods of automatic compilation, testing, and deployment of code via services and systems like GitHub or AmazonWebServices.
CI workflows can become incredibly complex depending on the overall goal, but they generally follow a basic series of steps.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Compilation of code in one or more possible environments:} A virtual environment is activated with a specified operating system and necessary dependencies installed.  Once this is done, the code itself is compiled.
    \item \textbf{Run a series of tests on the code:} Any test suite or series of calculations included in the code base are run, and errors captured and flagged for review.
    \item \textbf{Deploy or Release:} Successfully compiled and tested programs can be slated for public release or deployed to web-based services, depending entirely on the specific purposes of the project. 
\end{enumerate}
